Unfortunately, we cannot provide a warranty on our work for products of this age and most products have a finite lifespan. Would you repair a computer that is +10 years in age?

						<div class="section_title">Technologies</div>
						<p>With the improvement in technology, the standard of Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) systems in recent years have increased significantly. Access and affordability of high-end security systems is now well within reach of commercial operations and even residential dwellings.  Here are five features of CCTV systems that you may not have been aware of:</p>

							<div class="service_title">Night Vision</div>
						</div>
						<div class="service_text">
							<p>Once a feature of high-end camera’s and even then, the quality was very questionable. Modern professional (but residential based) CCTV systems now have the capability of identifying people within approximately 20 meters and have visibility of up to 50 meters. These systems are generally using an infrared night vision technology and are more than sufficient for most applications. In the event that more advanced night vision is required the utilization of thermal imaging is more appropriate. All objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit thermal radiation, even at low levels. This kind of radiation, invisible to the human eye, can be detected by thermal imaging sensors. Thermal cameras can produce images in the visual spectrum by detecting temperature differences between an object and its surroundings. The larger the difference, the bigger the contrast variety, making details visible. Compared to visible light cameras, thermal cameras can be used for applications in more challenging environments.</p>

							<div class="service_title">Motion Detection </div>
						</div>
						<div class="service_text">
							<p>No longer is motion detection technology restricted to the likes of James Bond or Mission Impossible movies. Almost all standard IP based CCTV systems now come with a level of motion detection. The modern systems use motion detection to increase the period of time that can stay on the recorder by only actually retaining recordings where something within the frame has been detected as moving. Even more impressive is that you can quite easily configure the system to ignore certain parts of the frame such as trees or flags to ensure the wind doesn’t play games with your security. Motion detection can also be used in commercial and warehouse applications to identify dangerous behavior or instances where people are in locations that should be off-limits. 360 Secure quite often apply this technology for manufacturing or warehousing clients, providing an enhanced level of workplace health and safety monitoring. 360 Secure is one of the few CCTV suppliers in Brisbane that works incredibly closely with our clients to apply these types of advantages to their business.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="service_text">
							<p>When selecting a new CCTV system you’re likely to come across two different technologies for camera’s, IP and HD-TVI. Although some suppliers will push HD-TVI camera’s because they may come out to be slightly cheaper the best technology in terms of picture quality and flexibility is IP by far. Installing IP camera’s provides a significant increase in quality and ability to compress video footage to retain higher quality footage for a longer period of time. IP also provides a level of flexibility when it comes to using camera locations for other aspects of a “Smart Home”, you can also connect IP camera’s direct to the internet for secure remote access rather than having to connect to an NVR first, this can provide an additional level of flexibility for wide scale installations.</p>

							<p>When do you most want to check your security cameras to ensure your property is safe? – Of course, when you’re not at home.. Remote Access capability is a standard feature of any modern security camera installation. A lot of residential systems with 4 or 8 cameras’s come with an NVR (Network Video Recorder) that will come with a phone app from the vendor for easy setup and use by the owner, this provides full mobile phone access to all camera’s in a secure way to ensure you’re the only person with eyes on your property. Larger commercial installations can either use NVR’s or separate software installed on a server that can provide more advanced features, such as raising alarms or opening doors.</p>

The benefits of this feature are obvious, with the owner having the option to zoom in on activity happening without having the manually change the camera angle. PTZ can also be used for camera’s installed at height, to provide a maximum visibility while at wide angle, but also have the capability of close inspection through the Zoom capability.</p>

						<div class="section_title">Installations</div>
						<p><b>Planning before installing a CCTV camera</b></p>
						<p>The most important aspect of installing a CCTV camera system is choosing the right spots for camera and DVR to maximize camera coverage and minimize cable length (which in-turn reduces the in line losses that affect video quality). For indoors, choose a corner in the room from where most entry points into the room are visible. A power socket should also be in close proximity. For outdoors, choose a higher spot covering the door, window approaches, garages etc. Choose the spots above 10ft so that it cannot be knocked down easily.</p>
					<p><b>Mounting the camera</b></p>
					<p>Place the camera unit at the desired place, make guide marks for drilling. Drill holes and hammer in the screw mouldings. Now, screw the camera in place firmly. Insert the power cable of the camera in a socket.</p>
					<p><b>Placing the DVR</b></p>
					<p>DVR of the CCTV is the place where the surveillance hard disk is present. Thus all your CCTV recording reside inside a DVR. It is highly recommended to keep the DVR inside a locked compartment so that even if an intruder spots the DVR, he/she can’t destroy the recorded videos. This is a vital step to ensure a bullet proof security system for your home.</p>
					<p><b>Managing the cables</b></p>
					<p>Plan the pathway for all the cables from cameras to DVR unit. Use wire moldings to keep the wire managed and safe. Nail the moldings along the path and put the Siamese surveillance wire inside.</p>
					<p></b>Connecting the wires</b><p>
					<p>The video cable is connected via a BNC port. Remove about 1.5cm of outer covering of the video cable which should now expose the braids. Slide the crimping barrel onto the cable with wider diameter facing towards the end of the cable. Now remove the white insulator covering the innermost cable. Now insert this exposed cables into the BNC port and screw the crimping barrel. This makes a secure connection. Connect the DVR output port to the screen on which you want the video feed.</p>
					<p><b>Power on the system</b><p>
					<p>Start by powering ON the cameras followed by the display and the DVR. Setup the DVR according to the user manual provided with the DVR. Go over every camera’s feed to confirm each camera is working properly and providing the desired viewing angle.
